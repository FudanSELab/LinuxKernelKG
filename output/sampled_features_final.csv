1895,Architecture-specific,s390,"qdio V=V pass-through. QDIO and Hiper Sockets processing in z/VM V=V guest environments (as well as V=R with z/VM running in LPAR mode) requires shadowing of all QDIO architecture queue elements.  Especially the shadowing of SBALs and SLSBs structures in the hypervisor, and the need to issue SIGA SYNC operations to observe state changes, eventually causes significant CPU processing overhead in the hypervisor. The QDIO pass-through support for V=V guests avoids the shadowing of SBALs and SLSBs. This significantly reduces the hypervisor overhead for QDIO based I/O",2.6.16

36256,Core (various),,Scheduler Improve NUMA imbalance behavior. On certain systems with spare capacity initial placement of tasks is non-deterministic and such an artificial placement imbalance can persist for a long time hurting performance.
