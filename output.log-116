Reasoning: The mention 'ASoC' in the context of Linux kernel documentation and audio support strongly suggests it refers to the 'Advanced Linux Sound Architecture' (ALSA), which is a well-known framework for audio support in Linux. The provided candidate directly matches this context, and there is no need for disambiguation as the candidate is not from a disambiguation page.

2025-01-16 22:03:37,944 - entity_linker - INFO - Selected 'Device driver' with confidence 0.95. Reasoning: The mention 'driver' in the context of 'ASoC Intel: Remove skylake driver' clearly refers to a device driver, which is a program that operates or controls a specific type of hardware. The first candidate, 'Device driver', is the most appropriate as it directly relates to the context of operating systems and hardware management, which is relevant to the Linux kernel documentation. The second candidate, 'Driver (software)', is also relevant but is more general and less specific to the context of hardware management in operating systems.

Reasoning: The mention 'ASoC' in the context of Linux kernel documentation and sound architecture strongly suggests it refers to the 'Advanced Linux Sound Architecture' (ALSA). The provided context mentions 'ASoC: amd: acp: add legacy driver support for ACP7.1 based platforms', which aligns with ALSA's role in providing sound card device drivers for Linux. The candidate 'Advanced Linux Sound Architecture' is a direct match for this context.

Reasoning: The mention 'ASoC' in the context of Linux kernel documentation, specifically related to Intel and sound architecture, strongly suggests it refers to the 'Advanced Linux Sound Architecture' (ALSA). ALSA is a well-known framework within the Linux kernel for handling sound, and the context aligns perfectly with this candidate. The candidate's summary also supports this interpretation as it discusses ALSA's role in providing an API for sound card device drivers.

It is part of the ALSA (Advanced Linux Sound Architecture) subsystem and is designed to handle audio on System on Chip (SoC) platforms.",

  "reasoning": "The Wikipedia page describes ALSA, which is the broader framework that includes ASoC as a subsystem. ASoC is specifically designed for audio on System on Chip (SoC) platforms, which is a specialized use case within ALSA. While the Wikipedia page does not explicitly mention ASoC, it covers the broader ALSA framework, which is directly relevant to ASoC. Therefore, the concepts are closely related, but not identical.",

2025-01-16 22:50:04,993 - entity_linker - INFO - Selected 'Advanced Linux Sound Architecture' with confidence 0.9. Reasoning: The mention 'ASoC' in the context of Linux kernel documentation is most likely referring to the 'Advanced Linux Sound Architecture' (ALSA), which is a well-known framework for sound in the Linux kernel. The provided candidate matches this context well, as ALSA is directly related to sound architecture in Linux, and the mention 'ASoC' is often associated with ALSA in the context of sound support.
